# RISC-V Single Cycle RV32I core

This is a Single Cycle processor running the RV32I implementation, hence a 32-bits cpu, written in __SystemVerilog__. It was made for learning purpouses, it's not intended for production.

## RISC-V reference

I recommend 100% to read the [RISC-V Reference Manual](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/releases/download/Ratified-IMAFDQC/riscv-spec-20191213.pdf), maybe not complete but those sections mentioning the RV32I implementation.

## Architecture

The architecture was heavily inspired in the 32-bits [Single Cycle MIPS processor](https://media.cheggcdn.com/media/b82/b820d7ac-b4c9-4dd7-af10-e3b3fbe250ff/phpPVaajI) explained in [Digital Design and Computer Architecture book](https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Design-Computer-Architecture-Harris/dp/0123944244/ref=pd_lpo_1?pd_rd_w=SEXjq&content-id=amzn1.sym.116f529c-aa4d-4763-b2b6-4d614ec7dc00&pf_rd_p=116f529c-aa4d-4763-b2b6-4d614ec7dc00&pf_rd_r=82ZAPW9VP21TKQM08AAT&pd_rd_wg=9EFiQ&pd_rd_r=75b9df90-d341-4fb2-b6dd-8ef3d3fa4219&pd_rd_i=0123944244&psc=1). Note that instruction and data are stored in separate memories.
